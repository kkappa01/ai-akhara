# AI Akhara

> An arena for model builders — to learn, practice and build confidence in Agentic AI, post-training, and production systems.

AI Akhara is a developer-first community focused on building model training skills and open AI systems. We're creating a confident community of AI engineers who can design, and deploy cutting-edge useful AI systems.
